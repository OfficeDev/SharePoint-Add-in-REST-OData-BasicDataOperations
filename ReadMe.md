# Basic CRUD operations in SharePoint Add-ins using the REST/OData APIs #

## Summary
Use the SharePoint REST/OData endpoints to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on lists and list items from a SharePoint Add-in.

### Applies to ###
-  SharePoint Online and on-premise SharePoint 2013 and later 

----------
## Prerequisites ##
This sample requires the following:


- A SharePoint 2013 (or later) development environment that is configured for add-in isolation and OAuth. (A SharePoint Online Developer Site is automatically configured. For an on premise development environment, see [Set up an on-premises development environment for SharePoint Add-ins](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/fp179923.aspx) and [Use an Office 365 SharePoint site to authorize provider-hosted add-ins on an on-premises SharePoint site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/dn155905.aspx).) 


- Visual Studio and the Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio installed on your developer computer 


- Basic familiarity with RESTful web services and OData

## Description of the code ##
The code that uses the REST APIs is located in the Default.aspx.cs file of the SharePoint-Add-in-REST-OData-BasicDataOperationsWeb project. The Default.aspx page of the add-in appears after you install and launch the add-in and looks similar to the following.

![The add-in start page with a table listing all the list on the site by name and ID.](/description/fig1.gif) 



The sample demonstrates the following:


- How to read and write data to and from a SharePoint host web. This data conforms with the OData protocol to the REST endpoints where the list and list item entities are exposed. 



- How to parse Atom-formatted XML returned from these endpoints and how to construct JSON-formatted representations of the list and list item entities so that you can perform Create and Update operations on them. 


- Best practices for retrieving form digest and eTag values that are required for Create and Update operations on lists and list items. 


## To use the sample #

12. Open **Visual Studio** as an administrator.
13. Open the .sln file.
13. In **Solution Explorer**, highlight the SharePoint add-in project and replace the **Site URL** property with the URL of your SharePoint developer site.
14. Press F5.
15. After the add-in installs, the consent page opens. Click **Trust It**.
16. Enter a string in the text box beside the **Add List** button and click the button. In a moment, the page refreshes and the new list is in the table.
17. Click the ID of the list, and then click **Retrieve List Items**. There will initially be no items on the list. Some additional buttons will appear.
18. Add a string to the text box beside the **Add Item** button and press the button. The new item will appear in the table in the row for the list.
19. Add a string to the text box beside the **Change List Title** button and press the button. The title will change in the table.
20. Press the **Delete the List** button and the list is deleted.

**Do not delete any of the built-in SharePoint lists. If you mistakenly do so, recover the list from the SharePoint Recycle Bin.**
